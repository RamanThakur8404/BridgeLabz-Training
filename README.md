- Creating and accessing objects

Practiced:
- Defining classes with variables and methods
- Creating multiple objects from a class
- Object interaction through method calls

Followed clean coding practices:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Systematically organized all **Class & Object** programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📅 **Day 12 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts**  
*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Methods

Learned how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

Covered:
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor behavior during object creation

Understood:
- Difference between instance variables and static (class-level) variables
- How static variables share data across objects
- Instance methods vs static methods
- Accessing instance members using objects
- Accessing static members using class names

Maintained clean-code standards with proper formatting and structure.

Organized all constructor and static-related programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📅 **Day 13 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords**  
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** static, final, this, instanceof

Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

Learned:
- Use of `static` for class-level variables and methods
- `final` keyword to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes
- `this` keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity
- `instanceof` operator to check object type at runtime

Practiced:
- Implementing small programs to observe keyword behavior
- Understanding memory usage and object interaction

Followed clean coding standards:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the `java-oops-practice` branch.
