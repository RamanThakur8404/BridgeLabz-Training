📅 **Day 3 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords**  
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** static, final, this, instanceof

Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

Learned:
- Use of `static` for class-level variables and methods
- `final` keyword to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes
- `this` keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity
- `instanceof` operator to check object type at runtime

Practiced:
- Implementing small programs to observe keyword behavior
- Understanding memory usage and object interaction

Followed clean coding standards:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the `java-oops-practice` branch.
