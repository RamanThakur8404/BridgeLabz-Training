# BridgeLabz Training — Java DSA Learning Progress  
## Week 3: Data Structure
## 📅 Day 1 – Data Structures & Algorithms: Linked List  
*(Date: 02-Jan-2026)*  
**Focus:** DSA Fundamentals – Linked List Variants  

On this day, I studied **Linked Lists** as a core linear data structure used for dynamic data storage.

### Key Learnings
- Understood the importance of **Data Structures & Algorithms** in optimizing program performance.
- Learned how Linked Lists differ from arrays by using **non-contiguous memory**.
- Studied the structure of a **node**, containing data and reference links.
- Explored different types of Linked Lists:
  - **Singly Linked List** – forward traversal using the next reference.
  - **Doubly Linked List** – traversal in both directions using previous and next references.
  - **Circular Linked List** – last node connects back to the first node.
- Implemented Linked Lists using Java classes and reference-based logic.
- Practiced core operations such as **insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching**.
- Followed clean coding standards with proper naming, indentation, and formatting.
- Organized all Linked List programs systematically in the **DSA practice branch**.

## 📅 Day 2 – Data Structures & Algorithms: Stack, Queue & Hashing  
*(Date: 03-Jan-2026)*  
**Focus:** DSA Fundamentals – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing  

This day focused on understanding **stack, queue, and hashing techniques** for efficient data processing.

### Key Learnings
- Studied **Stack** as a linear data structure following the **LIFO** principle.
- Implemented stack operations such as **push, pop, peek, and isEmpty**.
- Learned **Queue** as a FIFO-based data structure.
- Practiced queue operations including **enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear**.
- Explored practical and real-world use cases of stacks and queues.
- Understood the concept of **Hashing** for fast data access.
- Learned how **HashMap** stores key–value pairs using hash functions.
- Studied collision handling and efficient searching techniques.
- Implemented Stack, Queue, and HashMap programs using Java.
- Focused on clean, readable, and well-structured DSA-based code.
- Maintained consistent naming conventions and formatting.
- Organized all Stack, Queue, and Hashing programs in the **DSA practice branch**.

- Learned **Insertion Sort** (inserts elements in the correct position).
- Learned **Merge Sort** using divide and conquer.
- Learned **Quick Sort** using a pivot element.
- Compared time and space complexity.
- Understood **stable vs unstable** sorting.
- Implemented all algorithms using **Java**.
- Wrote clean and well-structured code.
- Organized code in the DSA practice branch.
