# BridgeLabz Training — Java OOPS Learning Progress  
## Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

---

📅 **Day 11 – Java OOPS: Class & Object**  
*(Date: 26-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** Core OOPS Fundamentals – Classes and Objects

Started learning the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

Learned:
- What is OOPS and why it is used
- Class and Object concepts
- Real-world object modeling
- Creating and accessing objects

Practiced:
- Defining classes with variables and methods
- Creating multiple objects from a class
- Object interaction through method calls

Followed clean coding practices:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Systematically organized all **Class & Object** programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📅 **Day 12 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts**  
*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Methods

Learned how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

Covered:
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor behavior during object creation

Understood:
- Difference between instance variables and static (class-level) variables
- How static variables share data across objects
- Instance methods vs static methods
- Accessing instance members using objects
- Accessing static members using class names

Maintained clean-code standards with proper formatting and structure.

Organized all constructor and static-related programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📌 **Note:**  
This branch is a continuation of **Core Java Training (Day 1–10)** and focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** in Java.
