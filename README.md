# BridgeLabz Training — Java OOPS Learning Progress  
## Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

---

📅 **Day 11 – Java OOPS: Class & Object**  
*(Date: 26-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** Core OOPS Fundamentals – Classes and Objects

Started learning the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

Learned:
- What is OOPS and why it is used
- Class and Object concepts
- Real-world object modeling
- Creating and accessing objects

Practiced:
- Defining classes with variables and methods
- Creating multiple objects from a class
- Object interaction through method calls

Followed clean coding practices:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Systematically organized all **Class & Object** programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📅 **Day 12 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts**  
*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Methods

Learned how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

Covered:
- Default constructors
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor behavior during object creation

Understood:
- Difference between instance variables and static (class-level) variables
- How static variables share data across objects
- Instance methods vs static methods
- Accessing instance members using objects
- Accessing static members using class names

Maintained clean-code standards with proper formatting and structure.

Organized all constructor and static-related programs in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

📅 **Day 13 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords**  
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*  
**Focus:** static, final, this, instanceof

Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

Learned:
- Use of `static` for class-level variables and methods
- `final` keyword to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes
- `this` keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity
- `instanceof` operator to check object type at runtime

Practiced:
- Implementing small programs to observe keyword behavior
- Understanding memory usage and object interaction

Followed clean coding standards:
- Proper naming conventions
- Readable structure and indentation
- Consistent formatting

Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the `java-oops-practice` branch.

## 📅 Day 14 – Java OOPS: Data Modeling & Object Relationships  
**Date:** 30-Dec-2025  
**Focus:** Association, Aggregation & Composition  

### What I Learned
- Data modeling in object-oriented design
- Object relationships in real-world systems
- Association between independent objects
- Aggregation (has-a relationship with independent lifecycle)
- Composition (strong dependency relationship)

### Practice
- Designing class diagrams conceptually
- Implementing real-world examples using Java classes

## 📅 Day 15 – Java OOPS: Inheritance  
**Date:** 31-Dec-2025  
**Focus:** Inheritance & Code Reusability  

### What I Learned
- Inheritance and parent–child relationships
- Single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance
- Method overriding
- `extends` and `super` keywords

### Practice
- Reusing code using inheritance
- Overriding methods for customized behavior

## 📅 Day 16 – Java OOPS: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes & Interfaces  
**Date:** 01-Jan-2026  
**Focus:** Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes & Interfaces  

### What I Learned & Implemented
- Encapsulation using private variables and getters/setters
- Polymorphism with method overriding
- Abstract classes for partial abstraction
- Interfaces to define standard contracts

### Practice
- Identifying entities and responsibilities
- Designing classes, methods, and relationships
