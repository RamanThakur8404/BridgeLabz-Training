## 📅 Day 11 – Core Java Scenario-Based Problems  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

Worked on new **real-world Core Java scenario-based problems**. Applied loops, conditionals, and clean coding practices.

**Problems Implemented:**

1. 🚗 **Parking Lot Gate System**  
   - Develop a smart parking system.  
   - Options: Park, Exit, Show Occupancy  
   - Used `switch-case` for menu selection.  
   - `while` loop continues until the parking lot is full or the user exits.

2. 🎲 **The Number Guessing Game**  
   - Player guesses a number between 1 and 100.  
   - Used `do-while` loop.  
   - Gives hints: "Too high" or "Too low".  
   - Counts attempts and exits after 5 wrong tries.

3. 🛍️ **Shopkeeper’s Discount Dashboard**  
   - Shopkeeper gives discounts based on total bill.  
   - Input item prices in a `for` loop.  
   - Used `if-else` for discount logic.  
   - Followed proper indentation, constants, and comments.

4. 🚍 **School Bus Attendance System**  
   - Track 10 students' presence.  
   - Used `for-each` loop on student names.  
   - Asked "Present or Absent?" for each student.  
   - Printed total present and absent counts.

5. 📱 **Phone Recharge Simulator**  
   - Take the user's mobile operator and recharge amount.  
   - Used `switch` to display operator offers.  
   - Loop allows repeated recharges.  
   - Show balance after each recharge.

Followed clean coding practices:
- Proper naming conventions
- Indentation and structure
- Meaningful comments

Organized all **scenario-based programs** in the `core-java-practice` branch.
